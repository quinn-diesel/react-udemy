Here are the notes that I will write down from the course. These can be used as a point of reference later.

It will also help me to write better readmes in the future hopefully.

----- SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION TO REACT ------

3 - web pack and web pack are going to be the transpilers that are going to be used by the browser
4 - node program manager install and then npm start to get it all started

5 - remember components are what are mashed together to make different things
- it is these components that will be ultimately used in html

6 - you have to tell the html to generate the component
const: this is declaring a variable, the only difference, this will be the final variable. it will be constant! you won't re-assign what this is going to be later.
jsx: subset of js that looks like html that is actually js. webpack and babel are going to the code transpilling.

7 - we use const because this will never change at any time
- JSX cannot be interpreted by the browser, this is what webpack and babel are going to be used for
- why JSX? this is what produces the actual HTML that gets inserted into the DOM when we render (place the components onto the page).
- HTML into page into what we want to see
- JSX - produce html so the person can use this
- don't have to write JSX get transpiled to vanilla javascript
- get compiled but it's really ugly.
- JSX is more readabl overall
